            <p> Right now I am trying to be a full stack developer. Like everyone, I have some issues
                Though, I am not worried about that. As I am married and have on Kid as well as I have a 
                fulll time job, it becomes really hard to manage time.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I am enjoying the course and strongly believe that I can join the SCIC Group.
                Nowadays, I try to spend 4 to 5 hours practice. Sometimes, I feel lousy. In addition, my
                educational background is not CSC. So, it's really hard to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I am sorry that instead of sharing my goal, I just discussing my problems. BTW, besides,
                Jhankar vi's course, I try to watch other people course as Jhankar vi recommended. At learning stage,
                thinking has a very important role. Somtimes, I do brainstorming the whole poccess, what I learned from the course.
                <br/>
                Please wish me for the best
            </p>
